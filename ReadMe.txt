The purpose of this repository is to store and document the progress I'm making/have made as a coder. In an effort to continually grow as a programmer I have set a goal to code and push something to git hub every day for the next 365 days. 

Not every day will have me doing a coding challenge. Some days I may be working on a cool personal project, or perhaps a school project, sometimes a combination of the three.

Nevertheless, This is where my coding challenges will reside.

The majority if not all of my coding challenges have come from either Gayle Laakmann McDowell's book, "Cracking the Coding Interview", or Reddit's DailyProgrammer feed.
